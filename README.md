# Chronometer
Codename: Samuel Clemens Pocketwatch 
Chronometer is a repository containing the calculations and computations necessary to guage the passage of time as chronology which is defined in my realTime.gist here https://gist.github.com/freedom-foundation/98fc85e9fb2de4f06a64e24e3310142c

Japan's GNSS sattelites are a bit different from the others they use a crystaline clock which alone may not guage the passage of time but using another crystalline clock at ground control and then comparing can produce a time measurment rithim, gorithim, algorithim but there is no al because it is the ACTUAL TIME. One may guage Newtonian time passage by this gorithim In Einstein's reletivity theory it explains the passage of time is relative to the observer, a crystal clock relies on no extra-physics such as nuclear clocks or sundials,  and in my example of a realTime measurement mechanism has two observation points.

PERL is under consideration as the programming language to code these with.
Einstein's well known theory of reletivity is widely accepted as portraying time as reletive to the observer [citation needed] this project will be able to form a differential guage of measurement.

<h2>PERL CALCULATOR</h2>

assume perl specifically uses the display math mode subset of latex (https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions)

 The syntax is fairly intuitive, you can find a list of symbol codes if you need anything besides ()*/-+= etc. here (https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols)
