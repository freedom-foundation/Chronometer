# Chronometer
Codename: Samuel Clemens Pocketwatch 
Chronometer is a repository containing the calculations and computations necessary to guage the passage of time as chronology which is defined in my realTime.gist here 

<h2>realTime</h2>
Japan's GNSS sattelites are a bit different from the others they use a crystaline clock which alone may not guage the passage of time but using another crystalline clock at ground control and then comparing can produce a time measurment rithim, gorithim, algorithim but there is no al because it is the ACTUAL TIME. One may guage Newtonian time passage by this gorithim In Einstein's reletivity theory it explains the passage of time is relative to the observer, a crystal clock relies on no extra-physics such as nuclear clocks or sundials,  and in my example of a realTime measurement mechanism has two observation points. (https://gist.github.com/freedom-foundation/98fc85e9fb2de4f06a64e24e3310142c)

PERL is under consideration as the programming language to code these with.
Einstein's well known theory of reletivity is widely accepted as portraying time as reletive to the observer [citation needed] this project will be able to form a differential guage of measurement.

<h2>PERL CALCULATOR</h2>

assume perl specifically uses the display math mode subset of latex (https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions)

 The syntax is fairly intuitive, you can find a list of symbol codes if you need anything besides ()*/-+= etc. here (https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols)

## REFERENCE
Statement: nobody can keep time; nobody knows what time it is. 
 support: CIA wfb note on recent timezone change 
Because the timezones were changed you have multiple timekeeping going. Usually the NAVSTAR-GPS is 1hr behind general network time. Other GNSS may not have the same time therfore because of time only GNSS may not be inter-compatible although android has software to intermix these GNSS agnosticly.
