# Chronometer
Codename: Samuel Clemens Pocketwatch 
Chronometer is a repository containing the calculations and computations necessary to guage the passage of time as chronology which is defined in my realTime.gist here https://gist.github.com/freedom-foundation/98fc85e9fb2de4f06a64e24e3310142c

PERL is under consideration as the programming language to code these with.
Einstein's well known theory of reletivity is widely accepted as portraying time as reletive to the observer [citation needed] this project will be able to form a differential guage of measurement.

<h2>PERL CALCULATOR</h2>

assume perl specifically uses the display math mode subset of latex (https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions)

 The syntax is fairly intuitive, you can find a list of symbol codes if you need anything besides ()*/-+= etc. here (https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols)
